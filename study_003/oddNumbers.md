1. An integer, l, denoting the left part of the range.
2. An integer, r, denoting the right part of the range.

The function must return an array of integers denoting the odd numbers between l and r.

## Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function:

The first line contains an integer, l, denoting the left part of the range.
